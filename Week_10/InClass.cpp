/*
What is passing a value?
Passing a value is sending a copy of the contents to a function.  A = 5 then a copy X = 5, X dies in the functions

What is passing by reference?
Passing by reference is creating a symbolic link to a variable.  Instead of sending the value of A we literally send A.

How do I create a reference and what value do I give it? 
You create a reference by tossing an ampersand to the definition.  string steve = "perry";  string& rSteve = steve;
